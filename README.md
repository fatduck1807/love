## ⚠️ Important: Antivirus Notice
Some antivirus programs may flag this tool as a threat. This is a common issue known as a **false positive**.

- **Why?** Optimizers like *love* change system settings and are often packed into a single executable file, which can look suspicious to antivirus software.  
- **Safety check:** You can upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) or scan it with your own antivirus for confirmation.  
- **Transparency:** The tool only applies registry tweaks, shell commands, and downloads essential resources. No hidden installers, no data collection.
